Green bubbles represent incoming calls, while purple bubbles depict outgoing calls. The size of each bubble conveys the duration of each call â€• the bigger the bubble, the longer the call.\r\n\r\n##interaction\r\nThe user has the ability to interact with the dataset by using the keyboard's arrow keys to toggle through different sorting modes. Each key applies a different sorting function to which the bubbles react by shifting their position in the screen representing a different facet of the data.\r\n\r\nThe different filter modes can map the bubble's x-axis based on the call's month or set the bubble's y-axis location to the call's time, from 0hrs to 23hrs. Also, the positions of the bubbles can be placed in two different columns; incoming and outgoing.\r\n\r\n##data+process\r\nThe data is first downloaded from the carrier's website as a CSV file and loaded into the system. Once loaded, the data gets parsed and each record is turned into a bubble object which is rendered to the screen.\r\n\r\n#How-To\r\nToggle through the different filter presents using the keyboard arrows.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tUP: \t\t\tsort by time of the day (0 hrs to 23 hrs)\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tRIGHT:\t\t\tsort by month (Jan to Dec)\r\n\r\n\t\tLEFT:\t\t\tsort by incoming (green) and outgoing (purple)\r\n\r\n\t\tSPACE BAR:\t\treset to original view\r\n\r\n\t\tS or s:\t\t\tsave frame as .png\r\n\r\n#Output\r\n\r\n**sort by time of the day (0 hrs to 23 hrs)**\r\n![sort by time of the day](https://raw.github.com/luiscielak/talklog/master/121025_032658_238.png)\r\n\r\n**sort by incoming (green) and outgoing (purple)**\r\n![sort by incoming and outgoing](https://raw.github.com/luiscielak/talklog/master/121025_032149_358.png)\r\n\r\n**sort by month (Jan to Dec)**\r\n![sort by month](https://raw.github.com/luiscielak/talklog/master/121025_032156_420.png)\r\n\r\n**reset to original view**\r\n![reset to original view](https://raw.github.com/luiscielak/talklog/master/121025_032131_196.png)\r\n\r\n**sort by time of the day and month**\r\n![sort by month and time of the day](https://raw.github.com/luiscielak/talklog/master/121025_032203_481.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#Created by\r\ntalkLog was designed and developed by [Luis Cielak](http://twitter.com/luiscielak/).\r\n\r\nData was collected from 2009 to 2012.\r\n\r\nBuilt with [Processing](http://www.processing.org/).\r\n"}
