Green bubbles represent incoming calls, while purple bubbles depict outgoing calls. The size of each bubble conveys the duration of each call â€• the bigger the bubble, the longer the call.\r\n\r\n##interaction\r\nThe user has the ability to interact with the dataset by using the keyboard's arrow keys to toggle through different sorting modes. Each key applies a different sorting function to which the bubbles react by shifting their position in the screen representing a different facet of the data.\r\n\r\nThe different filter modes can map the bubble's x-axis based on the call's month or set the bubble's y-axis location to the call's time, from 0hrs to 23hrs. Also, the positions of the bubbles can be placed in two different columns; incoming and outgoing.\r\n\r\n##data+process\r\nThe data is first downloaded from the carrier's website as a CSV file and loaded into the system. Once loaded, the data gets parsed and each record is turned into a bubble object which is rendered to the screen.","note":"Don't delete this file!
